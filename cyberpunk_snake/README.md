- **Sound Effects**: Simple synthesized sounds for eating and game over.
- **Particle Effects**: Explosions when eating food.
- **Responsive Controls**: Arrow keys to move.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
2. Press **SPACE** to start the game.
3. Use **Arrow Keys** to control the snake.
